# Natural Language Parsing using SLR Parser with Grammar suggestions
CS6109 - Compiler Design - Course Project

Usage of good grammar and correctly spelled words helps you to write and communicate clearly. Whether you are working on an article, essay, or email, presenting your ideas with clear and correct language makes a good impression on your readers. Often while typing, one makes a lot of grammatical and spelling mistakes.

This writing aid checks for grammatical correctness for a given piece of text like essay, article, mail etc. It offers spell and grammar check and provides suggestions for correcting it. It also provides analysis of the script such as word count, spell checks etc. This writing aid can be used to verify the grammatical correctness of any text such as essays, articles, letters etc.

In this project we use SLR (1) parser for checking grammatical correctness and semantic analysis using NLP to provide suggestions to any incorrect sentence.
